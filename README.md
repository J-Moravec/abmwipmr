## simple_model -- Model of post-marital residence change

Model for post-marital residence change. This model simulate community of villages interactin with each others be mean of marriages and facing attacks from another community (that is not simulated). This leads to switch towards matrilocality on bordering communities and than, later, switch towards matrilocality of whole community.

This scenario was described by William Divale in his *Matrilocal Residence in Pre-Literate Society* (1984) and is supposed to describe mechanism for change of post-marital residence towards matrilocality (and than back to patrilocality) and thus explain at least this variance of post-marital residence.

This model is called '''simple_model''' to characterize his relative simplicity. It assume quite a strict conditions with a low amount of interaction between individual (restricted only to marriages in stage)
